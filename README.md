# Decentralized Art Authentication and Provenance System

A blockchain-based platform for verifying artwork authenticity, tracking provenance, and managing art ownership through smart contracts.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) revolutionizes the art world by providing an immutable record of artwork authenticity, ownership history, and provenance. Built on blockchain technology, it enables secure artwork registration, transparent ownership tracking, and fractional ownership opportunities.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Artwork Registration Contract:** Creates digital identifiers
    - Generates unique digital signatures for artworks
    - Stores artwork metadata and documentation
    - Links physical artworks to digital certificates
    - Manages artwork specifications and details
    - Handles artist verification and rights

2. **Provenance Contract:** Tracks ownership history
    - Records all ownership transfers
    - Maintains chain of custody
    - Tracks artwork location history
    - Documents conservation records
    - Manages exhibition history

3. **Authentication Contract:** Verifies artwork authenticity
    - Manages expert verification process
    - Stores authentication certificates
    - Handles dispute resolution
    - Controls validator credentials
    - Maintains verification standards

4. **Fractional Ownership Contract:** Enables shared ownership
    - Manages ownership tokens
    - Handles ownership transfers
    - Processes dividend distributions
    - Manages voting rights
    - Controls liquidation processes

## Features

- **Immutable Records:** Permanent artwork history
- **Expert Verification:** Multi-step authentication process
- **Ownership Tracking:** Complete chain of custody
- **Fractional Investment:** Accessible art ownership
- **Secure Storage:** Encrypted artwork documentation
- **Artist Rights:** Protected attribution and royalties
- **Market Access:** Global art trading platform
- **Transparent History:** Verifiable provenance
